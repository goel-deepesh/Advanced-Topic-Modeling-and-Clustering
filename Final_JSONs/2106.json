For this purpose the dry cell with palladium deuteride was treated by cyeling heating that activates the phase transition. The experiment was planed especially to exclude the disadvantages of electrolytic cells. We have developed a special method for the comparison of thermal effects during hydrogen isotopes sorption-desorption by palladium employing the conventional scanning calorimeter SETARAM DSC-111. Conceptually, the method is based on the different dependence of the signal recorded by the calorimeter on the heat input in the presence or absence of additional sources of energy release in a sample. If only reversible processes accur in the sample, the heat registered by the calorimeter will practically linearly depend on the applied electric pulse and the released Joule heat. When the application of the pulses leads to the excess heat production due to internal sources, the signal dependence on the heat released on the heater must be non-linear.",
