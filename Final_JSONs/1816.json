A meaningful increase of\nhelium-4 was observed during electrolysis with the Pd-D.O system, while neutron emission was not observed. The D+D+D fusion, 3D--t+'He+9.5 MeV, has been observed repeatedly in\ndeuteron-beam irradiation experiments with a TiD, target. On the other hand, in proton-beam\nexperiments with $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\mathrm{T iD_{x}},$ H+D+D-fusion: H+D+D-p+ He+23.8 MeV was observed. Considering this result, it seems that the 3D reaction oecurred between two deuterons trapped closely in $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\mathrm{T iD}_{x}$ and an incident particle of deuteron. The multibody nuclear reaction model can interpret both the results obtained in electrolysis and ion-beam experiments. It is considered that the lattice\ndynamies of metal deuteride is of key importance for inducing short-transient and closely packed d-d pairs and, thus, such fusions.",
