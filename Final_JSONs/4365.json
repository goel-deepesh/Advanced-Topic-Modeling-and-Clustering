By symmetry considerations, the lowest-energy feature is assigned to the normal-mode vibration perpendicular to the pyramidal base and the two higher-energy features are assigned to the two orthogonal normal-mode vibrations parallel to this base. The nondegeneracy found for the higher-energy modes reflects the non-square nature of the pyramidal base. Fr comparison, the relatively featureless Pd.Sis spectrum is also shown. The low-temperature DOS spectrum of D in $\\mathrm{P d}_{g} \\mathrm{S i}_{2} \\mathrm{D}_{0, 25}$ at the top of Fig. $2 y$ ields corresponding normal-mode energies at 31.4, 50.8 and $5 7. 2$ meV. The somewhat noisier D spectrum refiects the small amount of sample involved and the much smaller incoherent scattering cross section for D compared to H. There are indications of aditional scattering features above 60 meV, but it is unclear how much of this is due to vibrational contributions from the low-energy overtone, multiphonon scattering and residual H in the deuterated sample. More definitive results will have to await further experiments using larger samples and higher D as well as H concentrations. Nonetheless, a comparison of the current H and D spectra give H/D energy ratios of 1.57 for the low-energy and 1.32 for both higher-energy modes, refiecting an unusual potential for this pyramidal site.",
