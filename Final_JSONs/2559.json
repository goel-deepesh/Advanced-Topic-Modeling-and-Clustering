Unlike ordinary metal alloys, where a fairly good understanding is achieved through relatively straightforward concepts, metal\nhydrides pose a number of problems. First, hydrogen is usually much smaller and lighter than the host metals, and hence its motion in the host metals generates some unexpected effects. Second, a hydrogen atom is a stronger attractor of electrons than most metal atoms. Therefore the bonding nature between hydrogen and metals is different from a normal metal bond. There are numerous other issues facing the palladium hydride\nsystem, which is finding an increasing importance in various applications. For example",

Because the electronic specific heat is directly proportional to the size of the Fermi surface, the proton model should predict a progressively smaller\nelectronic specific heat as the H loading is increased. However the contrary is found in the related nickel hydride. Moreover from a chemistry point of view, H can more easily acquire an electron than most metal atoms because of its relatively large electro-\nnegativity (See Table 1).",

Therefore, the hydrogen drift (or in other words, an electric field assisted tunneling process) is characterized as that of a\nproton, $i. e., a+1$ charge, ar the octahedral site. However, in hopping from one octahedral site to another, the proton must follow a path through either the tetrahedral site or the\nbridging site, and the charge state at these two locations will also affect the time average charge of the hydrogen in a drift experiment. The path through the bridge site is the\nshorter of the two available and received our primary attention. The charge density plot at this site is given in Fig. 6. Table $2$ shows that the proton is roughly charged with 0.6 more electrons at the bridging site than at the octahedral site. This implies that proton carries an effective electron cloud of -0.6 with it as it goes though the bridging region when\ndrifting. Hence the net proton charge manifested in the overall rift experiment is $1-0. 6$  $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\sim0. 4$ , matching the typical value of 0.5 expected from drift measurements within the\nexperimental and computational uncertainties.",
