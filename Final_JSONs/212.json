As we can see, the relative clectrical resistance of the palladium is a linear funetion of the logarithm of fugacity in the presure range lo00 to 18000 at. This means that the character of this dependence is the same as well for pure hydrogen as in the cane where this gns is in contact with nuphta [3]. Under the pressure of about 17000 at of gaseous hydrogen the electrical resistance of paladium is the same as for hydrogen-free specimens at l at and the same temperature. If the logarithm of hydrogen fugacity is larger than S the linear dependence discussed changes the slope whereby a smaller dependence on the hydrogen activity oceurs. A similar relationship has been observed for nickel foils being placed in high-pressure hydrogen [9. Probably it is caused by the change of the phase character of the hydrides discussed in thin pressure range. The decrease of the electrieal resistance in the palladium-hydrogen pananhrdwatontrtrnon at sn onranadacalnome $\\\\\\mathbf{H} : \\\\\\mathrm{P d} \\\\\\approx0. 8$ forms a disordered phasc (high concentration of non-occupied octahedral positions). This may be the reason of the high residual resistance observed within these hydrogen contents [10]. As the hydrogen concentration increases to higher values this disordered state is reduced continuoualy what corresponds simultaneouily to the decrenne of the residual resistance. Unfortunately we were unable to measure the atomic ratio H:Pd in the high-pressure region diretly.",
