The a-particle yield of the a-p-n channel, for example, exceeded the theoretically evaluated value taking\naccount of effects of electron screening [4] by 12 orders of magnitude. Theoretical\nmodels such as the formulation based on the optical theorem [5] and the multibody fusion model [2] have been presented to explain the observed enhancements from refined points of view. However, the angular correlation of the reaction products have never been\nconfirmed yet. Moreover, it is curious that these reactions have never been observed to occur simultaneously, since the branching ratio of the final states seems to be of the same order of magnitude.",

The former produces 7.8 MeV a-particles after passing through the Al shield foil, while the latter produces a-particles with a\ncontinuum energy spectrum below 8.2 MeV through the Al foil. The reason why we do not have a sharp peak at 7.8 MeV is the uncertainty in the mass of the ground state of the He nucleus. The FWHM uncertainty of about 1.2 MeV [ 7 ] is calculated to result in the dispersion of :0.4 MeV in the energy of the a-particles emitted from the 'Li(d,a)' He\nreaction, accounting for the broad hump from 7.0 to 8.4 MeV in (a). It is not surprising that the counterpart of the a-particle, He with energy around 6.1 MeV, have never been measured simultaneously, since the He travels only about 10 fm during its life time. The a-particle energy was observed to decrease with increasing detection angle, as is expected for the \"Li(d,u)'He reaction.",

Moreover, since carbon has been\nidentified in the spectra, it is possible that the 15.9-MeV deuterons are hidden by the contour of 5.8 MeV protons from the $1 3 C ( d, p )^{1 4} C$ reaction on the AE-E plot.",
