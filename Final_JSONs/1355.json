Actually, the real problem is that, the theuretical statements of LERN are not knonrn; in fact, no new branch of science has begun, yet. In this work, we seck to analyse the deuteron-deuteron reactions within palladium lattice by means of Preparata nodel of palladium atice and we will show the occurrenee probability of fusm phenemena according to more accurate, but not claimed, experiments, in order to demonstrate theoretically the possibility of cold fusion. Further, we focus on tunnelling the Coulomb barrier existent between two deuteroes. Analysing the pussible contributions of lattice on improving the tunnelling probability, we will find that there is a real mechanism through which this probability could be increased: this mechanism is the screening effect dae to d-shell electrons of palladium lattice. Finally the guod agreement betwvoen theoretical and experimental results proves the reality of cold fusion phenomena and the reliability of our model.",
