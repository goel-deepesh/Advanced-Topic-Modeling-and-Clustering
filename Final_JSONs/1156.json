The recombiner is fabricated by bonding platinum black to a nickel screen mesh and coating one side of the mesh with a non-wetting agent (Teflon). The recombiner for all cells of type D and some of type $c$ were enclosed within a nickel foil baffle that had extensions on cither sides which served to returm the recombination heat back into the electrolyte. This baffle also served to protect the recombiner from becoming contaminated with electrolyte residue. The recombiner for type $c$ cells that was not placed in the baffle arrangement was instead afixed to the bottom side of the stopper and was unshielded. The cell is vented to the atmosphere via an oil bubbler which serves two purposes: (a) to maintain near ambient pressures, and (b) to isolate the cell from the external environment. $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\mathrm{A}$ ",

Tests have shown that these stirrers have no were either pyrex coated with Teflon (type $c$ measurable effect on the electrolyte temperatures. (3) All surfaces except for electrodes and the nickel heat sinks are coated with Teflon. The neoprene stoppers are covered with form fitting Teflon tape and the cells\nt or made of Teflon bottles (type D). A special bonding agent is required to prevent the Teflon from becoming unbonded from the pyrex upon repeated thermal cycling. lt is anticipated that the nickel heat sinks exposed to the electrolyte should pose no problems since they are shielded electrolytically by the nickel cathodes. (4) The electrodes are as follows: Platinum (AESAR 99.95%) wire anodes were l mm diameter and lengths of about 18 em folded into five equal segments, nickel fibrex cathodes were formed into open ended cylinders having the platinum anode located along their central axis. Figures 3 and 4 are electron micrographs of a typical piece of 80/20 nickel tibrex mesh. Shown in these micrographs are nickel powder (20%) bonded to nickel fibers (80%) where the fibers are about 20 microns in diameter (Fig. 4). Also it should be noted that the nickel fibers are not fabricated from drawn nickel wires but are made from sintered nickel powder. These fibers are formed by extruding a slurry of nickel powder mixed in a plasticizer through a small onitice. After the plasticizer sets, the tibers are sintered in a hydrogen environment so that only porous nickel remains after the heat treatment. (5) Electrolytes were made of chemicals obtained from AESAR/Johnson Matthey and nanopure water (17 Mohm-cm) from a Barnstead filtering system. All electrolytes were 0.57 molar solutions. (6) A port for extracting electrolyte samples consists of a capped I mm diameter Teflon tube which passes through the neoprene stopper and into the electrolyte. (7) The electrolyte temperature is monitored by use of two 26 gauge type-K thermocouples. These are threaded into opposite ends of a 1 mm diameter Teflon tube that loops through the neoprene stopper to just below the cathode and above the magnetic stirrer. This tube is filled with mineral oil to permit more efficient thermal contact of thermocouples with the electrolyte. As shown in figures 1 and 2 these thermocouples are placed at different depths in the electrolyte. We find that these thermocouples read very nearly the same temperature provided the magnetic stirrer is operative. However, in the event of a stirrer malftunction the thermocouple readings may differ by as much as two or three degrees Celsius",

The nichrome heating element was attached to electncal leads so as to have it completely immersed within the electrolyte. The cell calibration procedure is as follows: (1) The temperature of the coolant flowing through the water jacket was regulated so as to maintain the cell contents at a constant temperature. A typical value for the cell operation temperature was about $3 9^{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\circ} C$ At this temperature the cells could be calibrated from O to $2 0$ watts while using the laboratory as the heat sink for the cell bath.
