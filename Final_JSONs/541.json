Since the croas section for the analysis reaction is about $1 0^{-1}$ of the 'He clastic (Rutherford) scattering reaction, it is immediately obvious that the deuterium concentration is comparable (within an order of magnitude) to the Pd concentration. It should be noted that the measurement was carried out at the center of the disk indicating that the deuterium had diffused through the entire cross section of the rod during the clectrochemical loading time. This dimusion (charging) time to reach the rod center is $\\\\\\Delta t=R^{2} / D,$ with $R$ the radius of the rod and D the difasion cocllicient of deuterium in Pd.

The absence of deuterium 4 cm above the londed area is consistent with a diffusiom length of only 0.85 cm for the sample at room temperalure for four weciks. The analysis of the nuclcar reaction data is complex since the experiment probes through the penctration depth of the 'He (about 2 um) with a reaction cross section strongly varying with 'He energy. Furthermore, the irst few mcrons have lost dcutenum due to out diffusion into the atmosphere during the two hours of cxposure for cutting and analysis (corresponding diffusion length -460 um).
