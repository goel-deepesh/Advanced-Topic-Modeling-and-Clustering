In addition, it is well known that the infiluence of isotope effects in solid-phase systems increases sharply as the specific surface of the samples increases.

This means that the entire portion of elastic energy supplied is absorbed not uniformly by each atom in a particle but is concentrated in individual microregions of the particle in the fowm of quanta of an electromagnetic field. This process becomes possible only when the interaction of a flux of elastic energy with a highly disperse crystalline medium leads to the formation of \\\\\"giant\\\\\" fluctuations of the elastic energy density. The possibility of the appearance of such fluctuations is assxciated in the general case with the presence of a broad size distrnbution of the particles being milled. When the mean diameter of an aggregate is of the order of several microns, the dispersed powder always contains a certain fraction with particle diameters smaller than 0.1 um.- Therefore, it is clear that when an identical portion of elastic energy is supplied to all the particles being milled, in the small fraction of the powder with radii that are 1.5-2.0 orders of magnitude smaller than the mean value, the concentrated elastic energy density can be $5-6$ orders above the mean value.

This situation provides grounds for assuming that the case of the *\\\\\"hard\\\\\" concentrating of elastic energy corresponds to the concentrating of the energy of a CME in one or more nucleons of a hypothetical atomie nucleus located at the center of symmetry of the disperse particle.

In fact, the discontinuity on the $\\\theta( S )$ curve, which is associated with considerable broadening of the reflections on the Debye powder diffraction pat-tems, ind e graphite powder is strongly amor-phized at $S \\\\\\! > 1 00 \\\\\\ \\\\\\mathrm{m}^{2} / \\\\\\mathrm{g}$ A sharp increase in the microstrains $\\\\\\epsilon$ and a decrease in the diameter $D$ of the coherent scattering regions occur simultaneously. This supprts the conclusion that because of the amorphization of the graphite paticles no elastic energy is absorbed in them, and plastic flow takes place, leading to the \\\\\"vaponization'\" of graphite. As follows from Fig. dc, after a milling time r=70 min for graphite in the presence of $\\\\\\mathrm{D_{2} O} \\\\\\left( \\\\\\mathrm{H_{2} O} \\\right)$ the mean width of the reflections taken from the [002], [04], and [110] crystallographie directions (like $D$ and e), does not differ from the analogous valwe for the original powder.

This indicates that after milling for 70 min, graphite still exhibits crystalline proper-ies like the onginal (unmilled) powder, while strong amor-phization occurs when -= 160 min. Therefore, the fluctua-tional quantum model of the fracture of particlesl- (the formation of a CME in them) is applicable in the present case only to $\\\\\\mathbf{C}+\\\\\\mathbf{D}_{2} \\\\\\mathbf{O} \\\\\\( \\\\\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\\\\\mathbf{O} )$ systems milled for $\\\tau=7 0$ min and cannot be used for powders milled for 160 min. We note that in the case of the amorphization of the graphite particles, the concept of a limiting minimum diameter is meaningless; therefore, when S> 100 m-/g (Fig. 3, curve $I 0$ graphite can bhe ground to paricle diameters as small as we wish. These data also provide evidence that the region of applicability of the fluctuational quantum model of the fracture of graphite paticles corresponds to S<100 m $r_{8}$ when $\\\tau=7 0$ min, where they exist predominantly in the crystalline, rather than the amorphous state.",
