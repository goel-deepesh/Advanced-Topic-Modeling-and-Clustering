In the course of our calculations, we needed a fit for the deuteron-deuteron fusion cross section for neutron production. The cross sections are available online in the Los Alamos ENDFB-VI nuclear data compilation. A table of them can be downloaded [1]. However, for numerical work it is useful to have a simple fitted version. After searching for a while in the literature, it seemed worthwhile to develop fits that were useful for our purposes. Perhaps these may also be useful for others as well.",
