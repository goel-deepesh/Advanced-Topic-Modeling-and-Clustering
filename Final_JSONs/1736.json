This is similar to the fission of uranium at $A=1 1 9$ where the local maximum follows from the Marubn-Greiner theory if the splitting nuclei are excited to about MeV energy. The LENR generated elements ean be documented any time after the reaction by SIMS or K-shell X-ray excitation to show the very unique distnbution with the local maximum. An explanation is based on the strong Debye screening of the Maxwellian deuterons within the degenerate rigid electron background especially within the swimming electron layer at the metal surface or at interfaces. The deuterons behave like neutrals at distances of about $2$ picometers. They may form clusters due to sof attraction in the range above thermal energy. Clusters of 10 pm diameter may react over long time probabilities (megaseconds) with Pd nuclei leading to a double magie number compound nucleus which splits like in fission to the $A=1$ 53 element distribution.",

While we let this question open until much more transparent convincing results abkout this pherkomenon will be at hand, we mainly concentrate here on the LENR processes as known and hkow a solid base of knowledge will be gained from more details. The safe basis of the here discussed results is a similarity of measured distributions of nuclei [3, 7] generated by LENR with the well established results from fission of uranium. Special attention is given to the general minimum of the distribution of resulting fission products [8] where at the absolute minimum, a local maximum [9] exists. In Section Maruhn-Greiner Maximum at Nuclear Fission Mass Distribution' we summarise the basic facts known from uranium fission and in Section \"LENR Results\"\" facts from LENR observations including the derived conclusions about magic numbers.

This distribution with the absolute minimum, however, refers to unexcited splitting nuclei having a very low temperature. In the case that these nuclei are excited to higher temperature in the MeV range, the distribution is changed having then a local maximum at the mentioned absolute minimum of the unexcited state. The analysis based on the drop model of nuclei fully reproduced this loeal maximum as it was shown by Marwhn and Greiner [9]. These calculations are based on collective mass parameters from the BSC formulation where the parameter $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\dot{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\imath}$ of the length in the Schrodinger equation for the splitting heavy nuelei follows the models of nuclear molecules [12] has to be fit according to the theory of fragmentation dynamics in nucleus-nucleus collisions [9].",

One of the tools for these experiments were the multi-million-volt accelerators, e.g-that of Cockroft and Walton. Cockroft was sufficiently adventurous to use--against all the knowledge for applying many million volts--to look what happens when only 100-200 kV were used: there the light nuclei did react [21] e.g-protons with boron. It was then Oliphant's gas discharge technique for 100 keV beams to provide the necessary high currents to get more precise results, e.g. the correct energy gain from the proton-boron reaction [22] as the prelude to the discovery [23, 24] of the fusion reactions",

The main support for our LENR case is indeed the result of Fig. S which properties about the local maximum at $A=1 5 3$ is very significant. There is no question, if the compound nucleus (9) is roduced for a very shrt time (less than $1 0^{-2 0} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\s? ),$ it will he very excited such that the Maruhn-Greiner maximum can be expected as seen in Fig. S indicating that the temperature of the compound nucleus definitely is in the range of MeV.",
