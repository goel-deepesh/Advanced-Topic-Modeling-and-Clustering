However, this phenomenon is still not well accepted among researchers because of poor reproducibility and control. What is urgently needed now is to obtain precise and quantitative relationships between potential nuclear reactions and their corresponding reaction proxducts. If nuclear reactions induced by electrochemical reaction occur in solid electrodes, there must be clear evidence such as the evolution of radioisotopes and radiation. Moreover, the evolution of the reaction products should be explained in tems of the nuclear mechanisms. In this work, evidence which indicates the occurnence of some nuclear reactions is presented, in the form of transmuted elements within the cathode and on the cathde surface. The anomalous isotopic distribution of these elements shows they do not come from contamination. For example, natural copper is 70% *Cu, and 30% *Cu. But the copper found in the cathode was 100% Cu, with no detectable levels of Cu. Natral isotpic distibuion vars byless than 0.001% for copper.",
