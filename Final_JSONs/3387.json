The embedded-atom model adopted here does a good job of deacribing the H-Pd atomie forces probed by incohcrent inclastic ncutron scattering. The time correlation functions associated with the computed spectra are strongly damped and indicative of the anharmonicity that has been sugested as the principal contribution to the anomn-lous isotope dependence of the supercoaducting transition temperature in PdH. These results highligha the fact that the H-atom vibrations in Pd-H solutions are low-frequency, large-amplitude vibrations relative to vibrations of H atoms in usual covalent interactions. The rms displacement of the H atom from its mcan position in the ccnter of the Pd octahedron compares favorably with the avaulabie neutron-difraction results.",

S was uscd without modification except that the model atomic electron densi-s were smoothly truncated on a sphere of radius 7.780 \u03bb This latter distance corresponds to one-half the edge length of the cubical simulation cell within which the interaction potentinl energies and the interatomic forees were computed with the usual periodic boundary conditions. The model atomic electron densities were modified on the segment (6.675,7.780 A) by substitution with a cubic spline which vanished with zcro derivative at the outer boundary. The equations of motion were integrated by the explicit central diference mcthod 1 3 or summed Verlet method.'\" The estimated standard error was obtained by assuming that distimct 20 ps blocks of trajectory were independent samples of the property in question.",
