In fact, all three intial experiments using this ammonia-based system produced large excess power effects [3]. This system was selected because the H-O analog is comnonly used for commercial palladium plaing 6]. However, the extended electrolysis at the higher currents required for FPE studies leads to a black dendritic hydride deposit, large pH changes, chlorine evolution, and otber unknown processes in this ammonia-based co-deposition system.",
