At the same time, the protocol is sufficiently statistically sophisticated in its rigorous application of Experiment Design theory as to satisfy the most skeptical and informed critic.",

The reader can learn enough about Statistics by reading The Cartoon Guide to\nStatistics by Larry Gonick & Woolcott Smith, HarperCollins (1993), to verify that the preceding provides the result claimed at the 95% Confidence Level. I showed my one-page proof to an internationally reputable expert in Statistics and he agreed that it was correct and said that if the experiment turns out as I predicr then he will give me a Certificate that the Confidence Level is that asserted and be willing to testify in Court as an Expert Witness that according to accepted principles of Statistics the preceding protocol is definitive as stated.",
