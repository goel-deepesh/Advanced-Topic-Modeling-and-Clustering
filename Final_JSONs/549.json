With an effect like this, a detailed consideration of all possible backpround sources is nec-esary. Besides the evident background sources, such as cosmic radiation, operating nuccar-physies machines (accclerators, reactors) we shall touch upon some non-trivial sitwations. For example, the heavy water itself used in experiment is a neutron source due to the effect of gamma-quanta with energy over 2.23 MeV (photodisintegration of the deuteron). Besides vanious kinds of technical contamination, natural radioactive isotopes, which are present in building materials, can be a source of these quanta.",
