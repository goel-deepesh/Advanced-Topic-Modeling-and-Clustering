Consequently, we should be able to start with models for nuclear states in isolation, and models for condensed matter systems in isolation, and identify the coupling between them.",

The intermal nuclear states are small and localized, with an energy scale not particularly well matched to the electronic or vibrational degrees of freedom of the lattice. The only coupling possible as was argued are the weak second-order electrostatic coupling (argued to be analogous to tidal forces in gravitation); or magnetic interactions which we might expect also to be weak. Mismatched energy scales combined with a weak coupling can never produce the dramatic effects claimed by Fleischmann and Pons, so it was argued.",

In the models that have emerged, a relatively weak coupling can result in much larger cooperative effects when many nuclei interact together. A down-coaversion of the large nuclear quantum would be able to account for the absence of energetic particles commensurate with the energy produced, and also account for the very large acceleration of the associated reaction rates. In an incoherent model we would expect the reaction rate to be very slow due to the (very small) tunneling factor bheing squared; but in a coherent model the rate can be much faster, since the maximum rate is linear in the tunneling factor.",

In a nonrelativistic model there is a elean separation between intemal and center of mass degrees of freedom, so that the only coupling is through extermal field interactions that depend on both. The situation is more complicated in the relativistic version of the problem, where thene is in addition a relativistic coupling that can bhe attributed to the change in the nuclear potential when the nucleus is in mation. In free space we would expeet thene to be no consequence of this interaction, since it is possible to transfom to a frame in which the nucleus is at rest. However, the same is not true for a nucleus in a lattice. The thought is that this relativistic coupling can mediate interactions between internal nuclear states and lattice vibrations, and it would do so in ways that we as yet have litle intuition abkout",
