        "text": "In a previous paper (Noninski, 1995) we reported comparative results of y-ray measurements before and afer burming of a mixtune of chemicals. Increase of $, ray activity after buming was claimed by some colleagues to be an indicalion of the lact that certain nuclear processes can be induced simply by carrying out chemical reactions. Although we observed an increase in the y-ray eounts after burning of the sample, we concluded that the reasons for this increase are trivial and are due to concentrating, as a result of burning, of the naturally ocurring isotopes of some elements, especially K. We noled, however, that there may be certain conditions, unknown to us, which may bring about the purported changes of nuelear character due simply to chemical reactions. In follaow-up of our manuscript, (Lin, 1995), presented data of B-particle decay when using a mixture whose composition includes fewer chemicals than those in the mixture studied by us. Also, the amounts of the various ingredients in the mixture differed from thse used in (Noninski). We carried out a series of measurements of the B-particle emission activity with this new recipe and are reporting the results from these studies in the present communication.",

The p-counting of that sample was done in a manner similar to that by which the data in (Lin) were obtained. As seen from Figure 2 a decrease of the p-counts in time, similar to that reported in (Lin), is clearly observable. The question which then had to be answered is whether this decrease is due to nuclear decay or to some trivial reason. One trivial reason may be the hygroscopicity of the sample, as mentioned in our previous publication (Noninski). One of the sources of B-emission from the sample is the decay of the naturally occurring radioactive isotopes such as K. Absorption of water vapors would be an attenuating factor for this naturally",

Another factor which may cause attenuation is oxidation of the ashes from the bum. Instead of further exploring whether absorption of water vapors or oxidation is the trivial cause for B-emis-sion decrease we decided to measure p-emission under conditions where any such cause would be eliminated. The measurement of p-emission activity of the bumed sample was carried out in a container from which a continuous evacuation of the air was performed as described above -- Figure I. An cxam-ple of the results from these measurements is shown in Figure 3. As is seen from Figure 3 no decrease of the $\\beta$ counts is observed when measures are taken to avoid oxidation and/or absorption of water vapors by the sample.
