At such distances the D induced clectron densities Af are negative, causing a depletion of the electron density in the vacancy, This reduction of electron density slightly increases the contribution of the AEils term to the total energy. For Fe, Mo, and Ni the lattice constant is smallcr and the D binds relatively far from the side of the vacancy. As the oocupancy s increased the D-D distances will thus be rather small and each deuterium atom will feel a positive clectron dcnsity from the other D atoms. This wil cause the D to rclax away from each other. This relaxation costs energy and makes the binding energy smaller. Nb is a rather open lattice and the deuterium-deuterium repulsion is small for cccupancics up to $N-6$ . We note that the D-D distances obtained within the vacancies in the present case are sugniicantly arger than the nuclear separation in the $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\mathbf{D_{2}}$ molecule $( 1. 4 3. 1 ),$ but significantly smaller than in octahedral sitc solution (Pd: S.2 a.u; Ni: 4.7 a.u; Cu: 4.8 a.u.).

The occupancics up to six atoms per vacancy studied here represent a lower bound and we cannot exclude even higher concentrations, We have shown that of the metals studied, only in Pd is multiple cccupancy favored ower single ocupancy. Furthermore, although the D-D spacing within the Pd vacancy is still larger than what is believed necessary for fusion, the D-D spacings in the vacancy are nonetheless substantially smaller than in octahedral site solution (5.2 a.u.). This fact may be of importance for the understanding of the proposed room-temperature fusion events in solid Pd. The computational approach developed in the present paper also provides a reliable basis for trcating D-D intcractions for interstitial solution as well as in other types of defects. Further calculations studying the effects of a localization of many D atoms in a small volume on the many-body wave function describing the motion of the D atoms and their mutual overlap are in progress.",
