Our reasoning is that any set of nuclear reactions which produce measurable heat must also produce abundant secondary \\\textbf{x} -rays.

(Chemical reactions typically involve eV-energies, down by a factor of 10* from nuclear reactions.) But energy release at the nuclear level implies that secondary x-rays will be produced, since only tens of keV are required to generate x-rays. If nuclear reactions are indeed producing heat at the lewels claimed $( > 1 \\\\\\mathrm{m W} ),$ then sufficient x-rays should be produced to be detectable. The x-rays arnise from the ionizing eifects of nuclear products on the materials in which the heat dewelops. Thus, x-ray measurements may provide a crucial test for the presence of heat-generating nuclear reactions.",
