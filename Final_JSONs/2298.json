The Na dissolution indeed proceeded peacefully as with 2 M solution for about 20-30 s since Na addition. The formation of a small quantity of white Mg(OH), precipitate in the glass beaker could be seen visually thereby confirming the Na dissolution process. However, at the end of Na dissolution, i.e., 30 s after Na addition, an intense and massive explosion cccurred, accompanied with Na aerosol release and a shock wave as well as vaporization of Borosil glass beaker containing salt solution. The explosion attracted the attention of everyone in the building due to its high intensity, even people in rooms far from the one where the experiment was carried out. Molten glass needles flew all around, making holes too small to be seen with the naked eye in two plastic water bottles at two different locations about $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\textit{2}$ m from the explosion. I was standing 4-5 m from the cell when it exploded. The needles seratched my hand. Borosil glass vaporizes at temperatures = 1000\"C. This fact indicates that a very high temperature has indeed been reached in this experiment. The timing of the explosion (20-25 s after Na addition) is prime fuacie evidence that hydrogen somehow got trapped in the solution. A normal hydrogen explosion accurs within 5-10 s after Na addition in dilute salt solutions, and the intensity of a normal explosion is not sufficient to vaporize the glass beaker. It merely breaks it into a few pieces. This situation was quite different. Despite the massive energy release, the stirrer was not damaged. lt continued to rotate, which indicated that the energy was released outwardly. It was also noted that the bottom of the glass beaker which was placed on a wooden stool did not vapxrize. This showed that the plasma-like condition was reached only on the side walls of the glass beaker, since a container free condition could be reached only on its sides. At the battom, this condition could not be reached due to the presence of the wooden stool which acted as a heat absotbe. Therefore, in future, experiments researchers should take note of the geometry and material of the container. Another parameter which needs to be standardized is the Epsom salt concentration. This is critical. An excess of salt would result in peaceful Na dissolution while a lack of salt concentration would result in premature Na-H2O reaction. It was found that to trigger the excess energy release, the 2Na => Mg exchange reaction in cavitation induced crystals as well as Na-H2O reaction should take place with equal probability. That can occur only at a critical Epsom salt coacentration which exactly coincided with the salt concentration (O.85 M) used in the experiment. The role of serendipity (accidental discovery) in the development of science cannot he overlooked. Such a massive release of energy, which could not be explained away easily by chemical means, calls for a close scrutiny of the process behind it.",

If sodium-water is the major or only mode of reaction, sodium solubility should not depend on the salt content at these relatively low molar concentrations. In contrast, in the NaOH solution, in which sodium reacts with water at all salt concentrations, for a given water content, the sodium solubility has been found to decrease with increasing salt content. This is expected from the redluced availability as well as reduced thermxdynamie activity of water at such high salt corcentrations. In an Epsom solution, a chief reason why sodium prefers to displace host metal rather than reacting directly with water is the difierence in the rates of these two reactions. The Na-metal exchange reaction rate in Epsom is fast at the crystalloid",

This technique ofers several advantages for alkali metal dissolution as well as for alkali metal (Na, K, Li, ete.) firefighting since the end products are ecofriendly.

Intermediate concentrations offer interesting possibilities of hydrogen trapping in cavitation induced metastable nano-crystals. The massive explosion witnessed in 0.85 M Epsom solution accompanied by the vaporization of the entire glass beaker containing the solution at the end of sodium metal dissolution could not be explained away by simple hydrogen combustion; the massive excess energy released as a burst deserves to be understood in detail-",

We will not know for sure how much energy is produced until the experiment is reproduced many times and the energy release is measured with adequate calonmetry. The energy balance assembled in this work is useful only in as much as it provides a reference energy balance under the interpretation prowided. This is not prof that the energy matches the numbers, or in fact is anomalous at all. There is the need to carry out the experiment in an appropriate calorimeter. The author is hoping to get support from funding agencies to cany out appropriate replication experiments in the future, and that such follow on experiments are very important to confirm that the energy produced really is anomalous. There is also the need to confirm if the anomalous energy release occurs only at a particular (0.85 M) salt concentration. lf the increase in energy release is gradual as the salt concentration is decreased from 2 to 0.85 M, it could provide a \"safe\" version of the experiment in the concentration at which the anomalous behavior begins. A still better approach would be to develop a fuel cell with a continuous flow of Epsom solution having appropriate salt concentration with another flow of molten Na metal to produce continucus excess heat energy similar to the heat production in Ni-H systems repoted by Focardi et al.

When the concentration of the Zn(NO3)2-6H-0 solution was decreased to 45% of its solubility limit (molarity = 2), intense explosion was observed once sodium was added to the solution under stirring condition since Na reacted freely with water to produce intense hydrogen.

In both cases the solution temperature raises during Na dissolution carried out under stirring condition in air. Hydrogen gas is released in both cases and a blue fiame due to hydrogen burning in air ower the beaker is witnessed at times. In the case of NaOH solution, the rise in solution temperature is faster with increasing water content. This is only to be expected because Na reacts with water and hence with increasing water content, the Na dissolution rate is faster. The Na dissolution rate is very slow if the water content is low as seen from the very slow rise in solution temperature (Fig. 2a, lef). In fact the Na metal could be seen to rotate for more than a minute till it is dissolved completely in the latter case. In contrast, Na dissolution is quite swift with Epsom solution at all concentrations above a threshold limit as witnessed from the quick rise in solution temperature irrespective of its water content (Fig. 2a, righr).

Local hot spots can vaporize the solution and can turm an under-saturated solution into a super-saturated one, thereby promoting crystal formation. However, the application of Bernoulli's equation in this case has shown that cavitation occurs in the Epsom solution not because of stirming but because of exothermicity arising during the exothermic reaction of Na2O layer surrounding the Na metal, followed by exothermic sodium metal dissolution. These local boiling spots are distributed throughout the solution by the stiring. Due to the small size of the stirrer blades (a few centimeters) the pressure drop is too $(>-27.5$ small to cause boiling of water at room temperature despite the high speed (10) rpm). In ntrast, rotation of water stream for e.g., by a ship propeller of 8 m diameter with a tip velocity higher than 40 m $s^{-1}$ ereates a high vacuum\ninch Hg) due to its larger length (a few meters); this pressure drop is large enough to cause boiling even at room temperature, despite the relatively low speed of rotation (100 rpm). This is conventional cavitation. But in this experiment, the highly exothermic Na reactions cause local hot spots which lead to cavitation-induced meta-stable crystals. This is known as steam cavitation. A recent study shows that if a steam bubble is introduced in a cold-water pool, due to a fast condensation of the steam from the surface of this bubble, a phenomena similar to the cavitational collapse of the bubble occurs. The steam bubble cavitation process was found to be more efficient compared to conventional processes because of the elimination of intermediate energy [5]. A recent study confirms that gas bubbles formed by absorbing the heat of vaporization from surrounding environment can be used to tailor the kineties of the nucleation and growth of inrganic nano-crystals in a colloadal synthesis [6]. In this experiment, gas bubbles generated from boiling solvents under atmospherie pressure (or under vacuum) were shown to facilitate the formation of iron oxide nano-crystals.

Before the Na-H.O reaction commences, or during its early onset, the cation-exchange reaction becomes the predominant mode of Na-dissolution in a concentrated Epsom solution. Although the rate of reaction of Mg with water is slow when compared to Na, all the Mig atoms expelled do not react with water instantly since a porion of Mg atoms released could get trapped again and again in the MgSO4 crystalloids, additively similar to what happens to the sodium atoms in Na,SO4 crystals formed due to cavitation, as depicted in Table 3c. Such a retrapping process would slow down the release of Mg atoms into the salt solution. The Mg atoms displaced will react relatively slowly with water to form Mg(OH)2 and hydrogen until all the Mig atoms are released into the solution. Thus the sodium dissolution",
