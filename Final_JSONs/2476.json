It is clear, however, that the possibility of observing DD reactions and the corresponding ncutrons depends both on the conditions of sample preparation and on the experimental conditions. In this connection. metals of group IV of the periodic system are of the greatest interest, since these are able to be strongly saturated by deuterium (the ratio of dcuterium to metal is 2: $D$ and possess very low equilibnum phase pressures of deuterium, say, $1 0^{-4}-1 0^{-3}$ mm Hg [4].",

Afler a total milling time of 1800 s, the spe-cifie surface of the obtained ZrD, powder was measured by the BET method in accordance with the low-temperature adsorption of nitrogen, and amounted to abou1 6.0 m-/g for the Zr+ 4% PP(D,)+ 10% D.0 systems.

Measuremenis carried out with the use of a neutron source have demonstrated that mosi of the pulses have an energy corresponding to that of channels 2-32 of the Al-264 style amplitude analyzer used by us (fig. la).
