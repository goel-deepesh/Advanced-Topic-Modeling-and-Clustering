According to the QM, a particle field is described by means of a matter (De Broglie) wave, which includes the notion of a particle matter. If we want to unify the physical meaning of the notions which derive either from the GRT or the $Q M$ the following principles should be valid : Principle $I$ \"Any infinitesimal spacetime can be regarded as a matter wave\". Principle $H$ \"The energy $o f$ amy oseillating infinitesimal spacetime is equivalent to its internal time\"; where as internal time is defined a time $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\mathfrak{I}$ of a phenomenon of comparison. The hypothesis of the Quantum Space-Time(QST) [1,2] is based on these principles and implies that space-time is stochastic and it can be regarded as matter -ether. However, matter can be either mass or charge. Thus, there exist both mass-gravitational (g) and charge-electromagnetic (em) spacetime. The (em) spacetime behaves as a (g) spacetime , since both are spacetime and obey the same principles I,ll, but it is not. Thus, any time interval in the (em) spacetime is incomprehensible with respect to a coexisting (g) spacetime and it can be regarded as an imaginary number which is incomprehensible too. Aecording to principle $H$ the energy of an infinitesimal (em) spcetime can be regarded as imaginary since it is equivalent to an (em) time interval. Therefore, in general, the electromagnetic energy can be regarded as imaginary. A gravitational spacetime energy $E_{s}$ can be converted into an electromagnetic spacetime energy $E_{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\mathrm{c o}}$ by means of photons and vice versa. Thus, in a closed system , the conservation principle can be applied as follows:",

                "text": "i.e., the product of the energy expectation value of a particle field multiplied by the expectation value of the volume which contains that energy, is equal to he. In general, it can be proved that the volume $V_{s}$ increase of a closed system has as a result the energy $E_{g}$ decrease and vice versa. Thus, when ${\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\overline{{E}}}_{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\pi} {}^{U}$ is very high, the volume ${\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\overline{{V}}}_{s} {}^{U}$ that contains ${\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\overline{{E}}}_{g} {}^{U}$ will be very low. Universe's expnansion means increase of ${\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\overline{{V}}}_{s} {}^{U}$ and decrease of ${\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\overline{{E}}}_{g} {}^{U}$ as well as increase of $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\overline{{{E}}}_{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\mathrm{e n-g}} {}^{U}$ according to the equation (2). From the equation (2) it is derived that for positive value of ${\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\overline{{E}}}_{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\pi} {}^{U}$ the ${\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\overline{{E}}}_{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\mathrm{e m}}-g^{U}$ value will be negative. Thus, the Universe evolution is a process reverse to that of the Universe creation, and during this evolution the quantity ${\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\overline{{E}}}_{g}^{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ U}$ decreases tending to zero, while the quantity ${\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\overline{{E}}}_{m-g} {}^{U}$ is te chare arey tending also to zero. We can assume that the charge energy ${\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\overline{{E}}}_{c n-g} {}^{U}$ increases sum of all the proton-electron couples regardless of whether they are joined or not. This means that the absolute value of the proton charge, assumed as negative energy, is greater than the electron charge - assumed as positive energy -, so that the total $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\overline{{E}}_{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\infty-g}^{U}$ will be negative. According to existing measurements, the proton charge is 4,803206815x10-\" esu [3]. According to the existing data, the electron charge is $e={\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\sqrt{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\alpha\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\hbar c}}=4, 8 0 3 1 9 6 2 6 \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\cdot1 0^{-1 0}$ esu [3]. When there is a tendency for increase and nullification of ${\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\overline{{E}}}_{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\mathrm{e n t-g}} {}^{U}$ , this means that there is an approach and coincidence tendency between the positive and negative charges of the proton-electron couples. The electron charge, if considered as an imaginary mass, is not constant but it varies with its velocity; thus, when the electron approaches the proton, it will have a value able to neutralize it. Thus, the approach between electrons and protons has as a result the increase of $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\overline{{E}}_{c o-g} {}^{U}$ and due to equation (2), the decrease of ${\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\overline{{E}}}_{g}^{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ U}$ . Consequently, we can assume that during the approach berween $e^{-}+P,$ a graviational spae energy absorpton akes place . This mightbe compatible with te reaction [4]:",

In this way, a space-time energy pump will be formed, having as a result the gravitational space energy pumping and the production of photons that heat the whole electrolytic system. The above mentioned are also effective in the case of light water electrolysis given that exactly the same mechanisms are being activated in the cases of both the heavy and the nomal hydrogen. Thus, Mills' experiments $[ 7 ]$ can be explained on the basis of the space -time energy pump:; this is an alternative explanation since hydrinos have not been detected. The aforementioned concern an excess heat generated without any reaction. However, during the cold fusion phenomena there is detection of nuclear reaction products. All these can be explained on the basis of the following reactions[4]:",
