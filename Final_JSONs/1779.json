                "text": "Since 1994 the Torin Group has looked for the $* H e$ production in D/Pd systems by using an apparatus consisting of a vacuum-proof cell, an ultra-high vacuum circuitry and a high resolution spectrometer. Inside the cell a thin stnp of $P d$ is shrunk at both ends by two Cu electrodes through which an clectric field can be applied. The operating principle of the system is the following. After the circuitry and the cell have been emptied up to a high vacuum pressure, a known amount of $D_{2}$ gas is admitted into the cell at $P d$ room temperature. The deuterium, afier atomization and ionization at the surface, penctrates inside the sheet until the atomic loading ratio reaches the equilibrium value. By applying an electic field along the biggest dimension of the sheet the $d^{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\cdot}$ ions are forced to migrate toward the cathode where they accumulate. In order to avoid that this locally high concentration causes the deuterium to desorb out, the ends of the sheet are coated by gold which inhibits the flow out. The mean value of the loading ratio of the $D / P d$ system can be casily evaluated from the amount of $D_{2}$ initially admitted into the cell and from the temperature and pressure of the gas that are continuously monitored by gauges and thermocouples or thermoresistances. The vacuum cireuitry provides to fll in and empty out the cell with $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\mathbf{D}_{2}$ as well as with the other calibration gases. The high mass spectrometer is used to detect the gas components and their amounts before and after the admission into the cell. With this apparatus a lot of experiments have been performed in 1995 and 1996 aiming both to look for the most effetive conditions (gas pressure, cle field intensity and duration and so on) for obtaining a high loading ratio and to detect the presence of $* H e$ after the operation in the cell. The results, presented at the previous Cold Fusion conferences (ICCF5 and lCCF6) can be summarized as follows: a) the clectric fheld plays the most crucial role in loading the $P d$ shect and b) the production of ${}^{*} H e$ was observed in 2 measurements over $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ast$ . On the basis of these observations, a set of measurements were planned in 1997 with the double goal of increasing the ave loading ratio over the equilibrium point with suitable electric ficlds and of detecting any eventual $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\prime H e$ excess inside the Da gas after operated in the cell. This second part of the program could not be fulfilled",
