In particular, there have been reports of tritium and helium-4 production; emission of energetie particles, gamma or X-rays, and neutrons; as well as the transmutation of elements. In this communication, the results of Pd-D eo-deposition experiments conducted with the cathode in close contact with CR-39, a solid-state nuclear etch detector, are reported. Among the solitary tracks due to individual energetic particles, triple tracks are observed. Mieroseopic examination of the bottom of the triple track pit shows that the three lobes of the track are splitting apart from a center point. The presence of three x-particle tracks outgoing from a single point is diagnostic of the C (n,n')3a carbon breakup reaction and suggests that DT reactions that produce 29.6 MeV neutrons are occurring inside the Pd lattice. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the production of energetic (29.6 MeV) neutrons in the Pd-D system.",

                "text": "CR-39 is an allyl glycol carbonate plastic that has been widely used as a solid-state nuclear track detector. These detectors have been used extensively to detect and identify such fusion products as p, D, T, *He, and a particles resulting from inertial confinement fusion (ICF) experiments (S\u00e9guin et al. 2003). They have also been used to detect neutrons (Phillips et al. 2006). When a charged particle passes through the CR-39 detector, it leaves a trail of damage along its track inside the plastic in the form of broken molecular chains and free radicals (Frenje et al. 2002). After treatment with an etching agent, tracks remain as holes or pits. The size and shape of these pits provide information about the mass, charge, energy, and direction of motion of the particles (Nikezic and Yu 2004). Therefore, CR-39 detectors can semiqualitatively be used to distinguish the types and energies of individual particles. Advantages of CR-39 for ICF experiments include its insensitivity to electromagnetic noise; its resistance to mechanical damage; and its relative insensitivity to electrons, X-rays, and y-rays. Consequently, CR-39 detectors can be placed close to the source without being damaged. Furthermore CR-39, like photographic film, is an example of a constantly integrating detector, which means that events are permanently stamped on the surtace of the detector. As a result, CR-39 detectors can be used to detect events that occur either sporadically or at low fluxes.",

The image, Fig. 1b bottom microphotograph, shows that each lobe of the triple track has a distinct separate bright spot. This contrasts with triple tracks obtained as the result of a Pd-D co-deposition experiment. Focusing inside the bottom of the triple track pit, Fig. ld right image and Fig. 2a, b right images, it appears that the individual lobes of the triple track are splitting apart from a center point. This favors explanation (2) as the source of these triple pits. The number of triple tracks observed in these CR-39 detectors is very low. It is estimated that less than ten such tracks are present on each detector. They have been observed on both the front and back sides of the CR-39 detector. There are probably more such triple tracks present in the regions where the density of pits is higher. However, differentiating them from overlapping pits is difficul.",

Additional control experiments have been conducted that indicate that the trnple tracks shown in Figs. ld and 2a,b do not have a chemical origin. No tracks were observed when electrolysis in deuterated water was done using Ag wire or Ni screen in place of the Pd-D co-deposition (Mosier-Boss et al. 2007). Experiments were condueted by replacing PdCly with CuCl, (Mosier-Boss et al. 2007). In these experiments, the electrochemical reactions occurring for both the PdCl2 and CuCl2 systems are the same. At the cathode, the metal plates are out in the presence of evolving $\\\\\\mathbf{D}_{2}$ gas while, at the anode, $\\\\\\mathrm{o}_{2}$ and $\\\\\\operatorname{c\\\\\\mathrm{l}}_{2}$ evolution occurs. The only difference is that metallic palladium absorbs deuterium and copper does not. While tracks, including triple tracks, are observed in the Pd-D system, no tracks are observed in the Cu-D system. Experiments have also been conducted in which a 60-pum thick polyethylene film has been placed between the cathode used in Pd-D co-deposition and the CR-39 detector. When these detectors were etched, tracks, including the triple tracks shown in Fig. 2b, are observed. Besides neutrons, linear energy transfer (LET) curves indicate that > 2 MeV protons and >10 MeV x can penetrate 60 um of polyethylene. If the triple tracks were due to structure defects, they would have been observed in the control experiments. Since no triple tracks were observed in the control experiments, the triple tracks resulting from Pd-D co-deposition eannot be attributed to defects in the structure of the CR-39 detectors.

This requires placing hydrogen-rich materials between the neutron source and the detector, which will impact the eollection eificiency of the detector. In addition, when using electronic-based detectors, long acquisition times are typically used to improve the signal to nose ratio (SN). However, if the rate of production is sporadic and'or at a low level, the signal can be averaged away. As discussed vide supra, this is not a limitation for CR-39 detectors. Furthermore, the energetic c, p, $\\\\\\mathrm{T},$ and He species formed as the result of DD and DT fusion should also leave tracks in the CR-39 (Frenje et al. 2002). In principle, one would expect that the statistics of these interactions could be deduced by analyzing the tracks on the side of the CR-39 detectors that had been in contact with the cathode. However, differentiating these species using the CR-39 track data can be difficult. The size and shane of the tracks formed in the CR-39 detectors depend upon the energy, charge, and mass of the emitted particle as well as the angle of incidence. Calibration of the CR-39 detectors is done by either exposing the detectors to sources emitting particles of known energy or by placing them in accelerators used to generate charged particles. Even under ideal conditions, there is significant overlap in the track sizes of the different particles. In the Pd-D co-deposition experiments, the particles that are emitted have to traverse through a thin film of heavy water before reaching the detector surface. This will skow the particles down, which will further complicate speciation. Calibration efforts are currently underway. However, the effect of water on the energetics of the particles and on the size distribution of the tracks is discussed in more detail in \"Electronic supplementary materia\". In order to say anything conclusive about reactiom rates, the reactions need to occur at a constant rate. That is not true of the Pd-D system. Events that produce heat (Szpak et al. 2004), y and'or X-ray radiation (Szpak et al. 1996), tritium (Szpak et al. 1998), and energetic particles (Szpak et al. 2007) in cathodes produced by Pd-D co-deposition oceur sporadically and in bursts.",

Consequently, analysis of the CR-39 detectors used in the Pd-D co-deposition experiments has concentrated on looking for these three prong stars as their identification is unambiguous. Although the three x particles resulting from the -C(n,n')3a carbon breakup reaction can completely fly apart, as has been observed for CR-39 detectors exposed to DT generators, such particles would be difficult to differentiate from tracks that result from three separate solitary events. This is especially true given the density of tracks (Fig. lc) observed in the Pd-D co-deposition experiments using the current protocol (Mosier-Boss et al. 2007). However, Fig. 2a, ii shows a triple track in which one track is separated from the other two tracks, and Fig. 2a, ili shows a triple track that has all three tracks separated from one another. The relative size of the triple tracks $( \\\\\\mathrm{F i g. ~ 2} )$ to one another is not relevant. The $1 2 C ( n, n^{\\\\\\prime} )$  $3 x$ carbon breakup reaction can occur anywhere on the surface or inside the CR-39 detector. After etching, triple tracks generated closer to the surface of the CR-39 detector will appear larger than those created deeper inside the detector.",

Unfortunately, the liquid scintillation technique cannot differentiate an increase in tritium concentration due to electrolytic enrichment from generation as the result of DD fusion. One approach to differentiate both sources of tritium is to show that the observed inerease in tniium correlates with the prduction of 3.0 MeV protons. This has been demonstrated by both Lipson et al. (2000) and Jones et al. (1990). Tritium generated as the result of DD reactions should have an energy of 1.01 MeV (Srinivasan 1991). However, this is the energy of tritons that have been created in a plasma.

In the experiments conducted by Oriani and Fisher (2002), the CR-39 detectors were placed above and below the Pd foil cathode so as to not impede uniform loading of the cathde with deuterium. Although this experimental geometry is not optimum, they wene still able to detect charged particles significantly above background. Lipson et al (2000) prepared Au/Pd/ PdO heterostructures that were electrochemically loaded with deuterium. After electrolysis, the Au/Pd/PdO hetero-structure was placed in contact with CR-39, and tracks consistent for 2.5-3.0 MeV protons and 0.S-l.S MeV tritons were measured. More recently, experiments with CR-39 detectors have been performed using the Pd-D co-deposition process (Szpak et al. 2007). After etching, it has been observed that the density of tracks on the CR-39 detector is greatest where the cathode had been in contact with the deteetor (Mosier-Boss et al. 2007). This indicates that the source of the tracks is the Pd that had been plated on the cathode. The distribution of the tracks along the length of the cathode is inhomogeneous suggesting that some Pd sites are more active than others. Results of these experiments also showed that the production of charged particles oceurred in bursts. Control experiments indicated that the tracks were not due to radioactive contamination of the cell components; nor were they due to impingement of D, bubbles on the surface of the CR-39 detector; nor where they the result of chemical attack by D2, O2, or $\\\\\\mathrm{C l}_{2}$ (Mosier-Boss et al. 2007). These experiments also indicated that LiCl is not essential for the production of energetic particles and that the density of tracks significantly decreases, by at least three orders of magnitude, when H-O is substituted for D.O. Since the natural abundance of deuterium in light water is 0.015%, it is possible that the tracks observed in the light water experiments could actually be due to Pd-D interactions. Microscopic examination of the CR-39 detectors used in Pd-D electrolysis has been done in areas where the density of tracks is less. In these areas, what appear to be triple tracks are observed interspersed among the solitary tracks. The number of these triple tracks is very low--on the order of a ten or less per detector and are only observed in heavy water experiments. These triple tracks have been observed in every Pd-D co-deposition experiment that has been conducted using Ag, Au, or Pt cathodes in both the presence and absence of an external electric or magnetic field. When Ni screen is used as the eathode, tracks and trnple traeks are only observed when an external electric or magnetic field is applied. Triple tracks are indicative of a reaction resulting in the formation of three particles of equal mass and energy. In this communication, the origins of these triple tracks are investigated.",
