For the velocity of the deuteron is not large compared to the internal velocity of proton and neutron; the effective time of collision of the deuteron is long compared to its period. We have thus to use the adiabatic approximation: the relative motion of proton and neutron is approximately given by the solution of the wave equation when the distance of the center of mass of the deuteron from the nucleus is held fixed: the center of mass moves in an effective potential which is the energy $\\\\\\xi( X )$ of the relative motion; and the perturbation which induces the inelastic impacts of the transmutation is the term in the kinetic energy neglected in this zeroth approximation. In fact the cross section for the transmutation is then given, with a proper normalization of the wave functions, by",

To account even roughly for the observations on this basis, we are forced to assume that the Coulomb potential breaks down at very lange distances (-1.5 X 10-#cm for copper). The transmutation function is thus anomalous when compared to that for protons and alpha-particles, and it is natural to ansociate this anomaly with the structure of the deuteron, particularly its low stability. We wish to show in this paper that when this is taken into account, it does in fact provide a satisfactory explanation of the experiments.",
