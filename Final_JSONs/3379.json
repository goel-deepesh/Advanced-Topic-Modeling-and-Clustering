This of course results in isotropically-oniented grains rather than the preferentially-ornicnted grains typical of cast material.

An early attempt to melt and east in a carbon crucible/mold resulted in an excessively C-contaminated specimen. This method of using alumina crucibles worked very well for short castings with larger diameters. Long castings with small diameters had the expected difficulties associated with pure metals and their sharp melting points. Voids and defects were produced by rapid solidification along a very sharp solidification front. There was approximately 1% loss of material due to cvaporation. In all, six 6-mm rods were prepared of which four were machined and two were used as-cast. After machining, two of the rods were annealed at 900\u00b0C for 4 hours to remove residual work. The remaining rods were outgassed at 250-C for 24 hours in high vacuum, to remove residual protium without modifying the metallurgical structure of the metal. The 15-mm casting had a length to diameter ratio of 2 and a 12.5-mm diameter sphere was machined from it. All of these rods were carefully examined by x-radiography for voids and other defects, sunce vords will retlect the hydrogen activity as hydrogen pressure that may lead to catastrophic results. Some vendor-supplied 6.35-mm rods, received as-extruded, were also annealed at 900*C for 4 hours.",

A calibrated volame (1076 mL) was repeatedly filled with purified deuterium, which was expanded into the calibrated sarm-ple chamber (i00 mL). The pressures were mcasured with capacitance manometers which are 0.08% accurate, and the values were recorded, along with the gas temperature, on a 15-bit digital oscilloscope with disk mem- ory. The oscilloscope had the capability to calculate the composition of D in the rod from this pressure-volurme-temperature data. An inventory of the amount of gas dispensed was obtained from the digital data. Figure 1 shows a typical charging operation with the D/Pd ratios at a final value of 0.63.",
