Morcover. mechanism (8) together with (4) constitute a chain reaction.\n\nWith respect to the absorption of thermal di-neutrons by the various Pd isotopes. it can be shown readily that the y-ray spectra would be very complex but should be observablc somewhere between $7$ and S NeV. Fundamentally. there are three possible mechanisms for each of the isotopes. The three different kinds $\\\\\\mathrm{o f}$ mechanisms are. thermal absorption of n and of di-neutrons with and without dissociation of the di-neutrons. Moreover. for each of the di-neutron absorptions there are three different kinds of Nu involvements yielding over 30 possible $\\\\\\mathbf{\\\tau}$ ray lines.\n\nThe (102) Pd isotope enr ichment presents a very special case since\n\n$$\\\\\\left( \\\begin{matrix} {1} \\\\\\\\\\ {1} \\\\\\\\\\ {2} \\\\\\end{matrix} \\\right) \\\\\\ +\\\\\\ \\\\\\mathbb{N}_{\\\\\\mathbb{U}} \\\rightarrow\\\\\\left( \\\begin{matrix} {1} \\\\\\\\\\ {1} \\\\\\\\\\ {0} \\\\\\\\\\ {3} \\\\\\end{matrix} \\\right) \\\\\\ +\\\\\\ \\\\\\mathbb{n} \\\\\\ +\\\\\\ \\\\\\gamma \\\tag{9}$$\n\nHowever.

Moreover, according to the rules of EC mechanism there should be a detectable Rh-K emission spectrum. and this could be used to monitor the overall process. Of the other possible enrichment. Oxygen is another interesting one since that could be used to monitor any oxygen involvement in the cathode. Finally the involvement of Li in the overall process could also be used to reveal why $\\\\\\mathsf{L i}$ appears to be so critical in most of the present experiments. Considering the importance $\\\\\\mathrm{o f}$ gamna ray signatures for monitoring the various thermal absorption processes, it appears crucial to monitor these signatures with relatively high resolution and accurate calibration.\n\nSo far it has been shown that low energy gamma rays are involved in some heat production. Another very important source of heat production is duc to the L5255358 electron capture. This kind of vacancy\nbeen treated before. While the details $\\\\\\mathrm{o f}$ the filling of this kind of vacancy is a very interesting topic by itself, briefly. the electronic transitions that may be involved yield photons primarily in the UV region. The filling of this vacancy is exactly equivalent to the phenomena with higher $2$ elements, more specifically with $2 > 3$ . where the filling of the vacancy yields characteristic X-rays involving the isobaric nucleus. In this case the 555055419 so the filling of this vacancy may have nothing to do with the properties of and more with the partial density of states of p character of the atoms surrounding the vacancy.
