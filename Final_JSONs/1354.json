Gamow [7] demonstrated that using the Copenhagen interpretation of Seridinger equation it was possible to obtain the correct decay law expression. In this way the tunnel effect was universally accepted. Actually we are not able to understand transmutation and disintegration phenomena without the no-classical traveling of potential barner.",
