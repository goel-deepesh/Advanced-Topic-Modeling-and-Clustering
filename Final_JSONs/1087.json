Thus, Pd-impregnated alumina appears to be a suitable system to promote chemical reactions in the presence of hydrogen isotopes. However, the question of isotope selectivity of such a reaction still remained: why was the exeess heat observed during deuterium loading but not hydrogen? An explanation was proposed by Kidwell et al. [6], suggesting hydrogenvdeuterium (H/D) exchange as a heat generation mechanism in Pd-impregnated systems. Replacement of a hydrogen atom by deuterium in a water molecule or a hydroxyl group on oxide support is an exothermic reaction. However, if the same material is exposed to hydrogen, no exchange takes place and no heat is released.",

One of the necessary reactants is a gas atom (deuterium or hydrogen), while the other reactant is a particular water isotope trapped in the material due to its hydroscopie nature. We called the water isotope fuel. This fuel can be supplied to the material in two ways: (1) material can be enriched with a particular water isotope during the fabrication or (2) by subsequent exposures to deuterium or hydrogen gas. We used both methods to enrich Pd-impregnated alumina powder with the water isotope of our choice. By subjecting the hydrogenated material to deuterium gas we produced an exothermic H/D exchange reaction and the system generated excess heat. While subjecting the deuterated material to hydrogen gas, we found that the system absorbed heat from the environment This can be explained by a reverse H/D exchange. Expected gas products of the reaction were consistent with those observed using a residual gas analyzer (RGA).",

Powder samples containing 2.0% by weight of Pd were fabricated by the incipient wetness method [8] of impregnating hot HzPdCl solution into alumina, forming a slurry. This slurry was then dried in air at room temperature without calcination. Prior to loading into an experimental apparatus, the sample was baked in a vacuum oven at 120 C for 24 h. However, some water is still trapped in the matenal even after prebake (discussed in Sections 3 and 3.1). During the loading process the sample was exposed to air for about S min, during which there was a chance for more water vapor to be absorbed.

It is important to avoid any air exposure between the elevated temperature treatment and gas-loading steps, to insure that material does not reabsorb water from the air. We found that an in-situ bakeout at 390 C for at least 35 h is suficient The reactivation of the H/D exchange to its initial level after water reabsorption from air suggests that the Pd catalyst did not undergo any significant physical or chemical transformation during the high temperature treatment. Thus, it-suu bakeout of the matenal in vacuum for an extended period of time prior to the contact with hydrogen or deuterium is an effective method to insure that chemical heat due to the H/D exchange is not present during gas-loading experiments.",
