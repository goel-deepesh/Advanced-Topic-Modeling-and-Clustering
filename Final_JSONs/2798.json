However, relatrvisbc quantum mechanics has aready pravided a means to overcome these linmtations. Nevertheless, this \"anonalous soluton has been repeatedly rejected, based an the mathematical formalism of an assumed singular potential, simply because it has nat been necessary heretofore in the description of available physical data. The physical realities of a non-singular potential and its interaction with a relativistic electroe are not new physics and provide a soid theretical basis for CF (as indicated in another paper in this conference, and the references therein) and for new fields in femto-physics and nuclear chemistry. This present paper is essentially a reasoned complaint aganst those critics who proeaim the limitaions f the anomalous soluton, yet ignore the inappicabiity of their chosen potential to the real world where they claim the solution(s) fail. It also castigates those physicists wha accept the mathematical limitatios as applicable to the real wwrid even when presented with the evidence of assumpbons made where they are no konger valid. The paper picks a few of these alleged limtations and shows bow relativity and near-field interactions alter predictions based on the mathemateal models and appreximatoas used to characterize the conwentonally accepted observations. In dentities where the simple models fail, ar violate physical reality, and paints to the implications of extending the madels to better fit the real world and to properly understand the physical mechanismis) involved.",

However, the original law' must be corrected for source coafi gurations and relativity in the nuclear range. When mathematical rigor, without physical consideration, is applied to the $1/r$ \u00b7 problem at $r=1$ l, these details are ignored. This allows a non-physical singularity and its consequences to be introduced into the mathematics. Such singularities are encountered routinely in physical models and *handled\" in various ways. Such treatments for the anomalous solution have been routinely \"rejected' over the decades and, without experimental observation of the deep-orbits predicted by the relativistic quantum mechanics, it is difficult to rationalize such measures. It is precisely under these conditions that near-field and far-field interacions become mixed ('sequestration' fails [11]), symmetry is broken, and *matter' is created and destroyed. This is the basis for one model of cold fusion that uses the reduction of nuclear mass resulting from energy transfer to the deep-orbit electron to explain D-D fusion to He rather than to the normal \"hot' fusion paths of fragmentation into protons, neutrons, tritium, and *He [12].",
